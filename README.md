## üì∏ Preview

> *Example Interaction*  
> **User**: "What is a Python dictionary?"  
> **PyBot**: "A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a value. It's useful for storing data that has a meaningful relationship, like name-age pairs."

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
